00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:00.539
 As

00:00:00.539 --> 00:00:00.739
 you

00:00:00.739 --> 00:00:01.000
 have

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:01.519
 seen,

00:00:01.519 --> 00:00:01.799
 electricity

00:00:01.799 --> 00:00:02.039
 presents

00:00:02.039 --> 00:00:03.259
 risks.

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:04.500
 If

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:04.849
 we know these risks,

00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:05.059
 we can

00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:05.219
 prevent

00:00:05.219 --> 00:00:05.939
 them.

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:06.559
 That

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.879
 is

00:00:06.879 --> 00:00:07.000
 why

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:07.109
 it

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:07.139
 is

00:00:07.139 --> 00:00:07.349
 essential

00:00:07.349 --> 00:00:07.779
 to

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:07.949
 assess

00:00:07.949 --> 00:00:08.379
 the

00:00:08.379 --> 00:00:08.479
 electrical

00:00:08.479 --> 00:00:08.900
 risk

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:09.199
 in

00:00:09.199 --> 00:00:09.419
 the

00:00:09.419 --> 00:00:09.519
 work

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:09.799
 you

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.909
 are

00:00:09.909 --> 00:00:10.599
 doing.

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:11.319
 This

00:00:11.319 --> 00:00:11.599
 risk

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:11.979
 assessment

00:00:11.979 --> 00:00:12.279
 in

00:00:12.279 --> 00:00:13.229
 general,

00:00:13.229 --> 00:00:13.259
 and

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:13.299
 the

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:13.429
 electrical

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:14.039
 risk

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:14.279
 in

00:00:14.279 --> 00:00:15.150
 particular,

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:15.179
 is

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:16.520
 mandatory. Let's have a look at it.
